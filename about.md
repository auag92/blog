# Hey there!

![Thats me]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/me.jpg)

This is Apaar Shanker. Right now I am a Ph.D. student at 
Georgia Tech in the College of Computing. I graduated from 
IISc Bangalore with the two degrees of Bachelors and Masters 
of Science in 2015.


I am an avowed bookworm, a map addict, a wannabe foreign policy
wonk and a self acclaimed history and economics aficionado. 
I like talking a lot. I am a good listener too. I can be obnoxiously 
frank and annoyingly evasive. I like visiting places but I prefer
sitting by myself in the winter sun and letting my mind wander
through a good travelogue.


I read everything but I am slightly partial towards high fantasy
and historical fiction.If you like wars and histories and want to
figure out how the world works we can totally hit it off!

Enjoy!
Apaar
