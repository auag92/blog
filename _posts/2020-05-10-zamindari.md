Reconciling the social and economic realities of Eastern India with its history: An analysis of the impact of the Company's capital extraction mechanisms on the society in Eastern India - the changes it wrought and the long term consequences.

I keep finding instances till very recent times of Shudra and other non Kshatirya dynastic rules. More generally the shudra castes comprised the artisan/craftsmen/skilled labour section of society -> the Brahmins on the other hand traditionally did not engage in skilled activities (even land owning/tilling was considered a taboo). The notion that a given Jaati is superior or inferior seems to be a very recent idea, and particularly a side effect of british destruction of local economy.

In such a society, at a time when economy was fully indigenous (say 300 years ago and prior) who would be seeing the capital accumulation? Won't it be the local skilled labour and merchant classes - the weavers, the chamaars, the lohars, the sonars, the mochis, (all SC/OBC right now)?- and in appears that throughout this time the brahmins lived in penury on alms of local society, I had an interesting chat with a brahmin acquaintance who described that even to this day, in their traditional pathshalas which still exist particularly in the South.. the first thing they are taught is "Bhiksham Dehi".

Now, let's fast forward to the first 100 or so years of the British rule-- particularly the Company era. -> as the Company systematically dismantled and depredated the indegneious economy, even you and I observed in our previous discussion, that the specific classes that were acted the most were were these craftsmen and artisans (For e.g. the weavers of Bengal). They were uprooted, devoid of traditional income and forced to migrate to rural further contributing to the swelling pool of land less labour and now we look at them 12 generations later and we see extreme poverty.

While this was happening, the British also modified the local education system and more importantly -> made qualifications/certifications under he new system a requisite for jobs.Â Now think about this: till our father's generation the most common, "stable" middle class employment opportunities were in  Government Service. This has been true since British era -> given that and Indian private industrial sector simply did not exist. To serve in this system, and I am not talking about technical positions like engineers and doctors which were anyways very rare but for e.g. even the job of a peon -> qualification through a british school system was made mandatory. So the traditional vocational knowledge that was being passed down the generations among these artisans was made worthless at the same time as they were being deprived of the opportunity to learn new technological innovations due to the artificially imposed language barriers. We need to realize how grievous this loss was. To contrast it with the German system where a large of high school grads have traditionally been siphoned off to vocational training in Guilds and have contributed to their highly skilled labour force whereas in Bihar we have a community of ironworkers who totally overlooked by the current system but have somehow managed to keep their skills alive and now do truck repairs or make counterfeit AK 47s [link](https://www.news18.com/news/india/love-lust-for-ak-47-when-munger-turned-into-hub-of-illegal-arms-for-bread-and-butter-1878741.html)


Anyways, after examining the economic and consequent social spiraling of certain skilled communities, let's look at the other side of the coin. Macaulay's new education system/ access control mechanism lead to the creation of wafer thin Indian elite that was now beholden to the British instead of rest of India; for e.g. the likes of the Maharaja Duleep Sighs/ Jaipur Maharaja/ Patiala Maharaja etc; who now received grants from British instead of direct cess from their people (interestingly these financial packages were much larger than what had tadionally been the income of a typical Indian ruler - thus it was a wholly british manufactured stratagem that further increased the tax burden on the peasants while increasing inqueality). More generally, the "new Indian middle- class"... haveing matriculated and then graduated from the new minted universities - proud of its Indian certifications and working as clerks in various offices, living in the few cities, became distant from he rest of the society which continued to grow poor. At the same time, the Zamindari class, to meet the increased tax demands increasingly resorted to feudal violence towards the peasants. I believe this was seed of the caste divide and conflict that we see today. 

Lastly, I would bring in the exacerbating role of the colonial lens --- while all this is going on - in order to justify the colonial rule, there was a systematic attempt to translate into english and interpret the traditional literature to demonstrate the oppressive, exploitative nature of the Indian system. The university educated middle class particularly, lapped up these interpretations and regurgitated them in order to get good ranks in the civil services exams and get the "secured" jobs! 

Now a personal note: the reason I first tried to examine this issue was on observing the whacky constitution of so called general castes. While Brahmins to occupy important positions in large numbers - they actually arrived pretty late to scene  -- and there are several castes which do not factor highly at all in traditional varna system but are now general/forward/prosperous ... interesting these were the specific castes who managed to keep up and cooperate with the ever changing colonial rulers - adopting their language and education. On the other hand several Brahmin communities-- did not cooperate and give up their ways and were reduced to utter poverty.

There is the additional angle of mahdalits and the tribals; but I will bring that up in a later discussion...


brief summary of the paper on economic origin of Caste [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387814001588):

it postulates an economic basis for the origin of caste as a system built around endogeny...

it enumerates two primary reasons:
1. one sided economic hazard (old work) and
2. both spouses needing to collaborate for productivity. (the novel proposition in this paper)

This leads to:
a) the enitre skill based community  grouping needing to band together to punish non payment by the consumer individual or group;
b) the need to ensure skill level of both spouses to maintain economic productivity of the familial unit and hench needing to marry within same community such that inter generation knowledge transfer can be levaraged or marrying with a skill compatible community;
c) this skill compatibility between castes is postulated as a social distance metric among caste groups.


Very importantly, given such an economic basis, the authors argue... that in its origin caste was not a tool for inter community opression(page 5 bottom) but instead each skill based community would take to it out of its own volition to preserve its economic standing. The gender opression though is an orthogonal idea that the authors argue remains core to the preponderance of caste.

My two cents; keeping aside the gender angle - while economy was idegenous and prospering and inequality among the different groupings was minimal each community had its own interest in maintaining and continuing caste.
In fact a weaver, or a cobbler would have much more guaranteed and stable revenue sources as opposed to a brahmin family -> we can compare this to modern times where a Nike Executive or a Banker or a Tata Steel Engineer (all vaishya or shudra under varna system) are more well off than say a school teaxher or university professor. Endogeny leads to social distancing- not hierarchy however when local economies crashed or became deliberately exploitative( for e.g. tax collection under mughal and british zamindari) the caste groupings which still continued to exist became conflict prone.
