**Hi Sharvaree  and Sandesha - Welcome**

This blog is hosted on githib. 
This is one of the option we can explore - the other being hosting on platforms like wordpress, medium, svbtle etc.
In each of these cases the environment is fixed. 
If we want we can buy and put in place a custom domain name. Would cost around 100 bucks msotly.

Github allows lots of flexibilty in terms of how we can change the looks, stores stuff and some other technical stuff that i have yet to understand. I have got hold of this guy who is good with all this and is kind of training me. Hope to be up to speed soon.
In contrast we cannot make any changes in the wordpress template.

We can choose between this one and loads of other templates floating around and tweak to taste. One of the first jobs woulld be to add comment and archive featues.

**Sharvaree** - The topic selection is great. In fact it covers everything. So, we will probably put these under few broad categories in the blog. That we will ahve to decided soon. 

We also need a name and obviously posts which i guess we will source from other people as well. 

The blog is in a way is online as of now.
