**Hi Sharvaree**

This blog is hosted on githib. 

This is one of the option we can explore - the other being hosting on platforms like wordpress, medium, svbtle etc.
In each of these cases the environment is fixed. 

Right now, on github, edit online on github and have the blog running without buying any server space.
We just need to buy a domain name.
