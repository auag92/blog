What is money?  

Money to me is ultimately an expression of my faith in my fellow humans. 
Traditionally the bonds of kinship extend to close members of our family.   

There are three guys on an island -  Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom can fish, Dick 
can climb and fetch coconuts and Harry knows how to make and repair shelters. We 
can certainly come to a system where Harry can repairing all the shelters as and 
when the need arises, and Tom and Dick shall be willing to produce excess produce 
from of their crafts to each other and to harry to satisfy all their nutritional 
needs. However, what about times of excess needs or times of deficit production. 
Given a certain amount of production, how should it be divided among the 
three parties.

Of course, eventually we come to the idea of risk, i.e. how to account for future contingencies, 
as well as the issues of fraud or failure among current participants.

A moneyless society:

* How do you account for risk/ future uncertanity?
* How do you account for eventual reduction in productivity of all individuals?
