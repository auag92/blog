The new year seems old news and i am back in my lab after a short, sweet and bitterly cold winter vacation with family.

Its seems apt to begin by listing my resolutions for the new year. Let's see how far i can take them:

Physical fitness is a priority. I really let myself go last year - what with all the free food and zero sports.
 *  swimming thrice a week, morning jogs, badminton sessions in evening and going to bed by 12.00 should do the trick.
 
 * Also this blog- I have writing on chits and loosing them forever. This time I am going to make it permanent. What i write remains.
 Which also means that this blog is probably going to be an idea journal.
 
 I am going to add more stuff to this over the day.
 
 thats all for now. 
 Good day!
